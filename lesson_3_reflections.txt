When would you want to create a remote?
Dunno.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pulling changes could interrupt work in progress. I want to commit my changes in a logical group before accepting other changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones on github.
Branches are different.
