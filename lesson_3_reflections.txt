When would you want to create a remote?
Dunno.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pulling changes could interrupt work in progress. I want to commit my changes in a logical group before accepting other changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones on github.
Branches are different.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This provides the ability to work offline. I can easily determine what changes I have made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would used SVN. It's different. I don't know enough details to know what to expect as the differences.
