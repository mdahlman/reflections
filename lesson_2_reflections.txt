What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The folder .git is created containing git metata.
This is necessary so that you can then stage and commit changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working dir holds everything you change (as well as things that are not changed).
Staging is more focused: it's only the things intended to be commited as useful changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area makes it easy to diff working vs staging. Changes can be unstaged if they are not part of a single logical group.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When making a significant change requiring multiple commits. Especially if these commits might not make it into the master branch.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pros: often saves lots of time
Cons: potential for unintended results
