What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The folder .git is created containing git metata.
This is necessary so that you can then stage and commit changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working dir holds everything you change (as well as things that are not changed).
Staging is more focused: it's only the things intended to be commited as useful changes.
